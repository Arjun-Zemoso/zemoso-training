Setup
-----


There are three inputs to this problem:

-   Keyword: The word for which you want to conduct the search

-   Thesaurus: A set of words, each of which has associated synonyms

-   Corpus: A set of documents, each of which contains some number of words

The output of the solution to this problem should be the number of occurrences of the keyword and its synonyms in all the documents in the corpus.

For simplicity, in addressing this problem you do not need to worry about things like capitalization, partial word matching, punctuation, etc. and you do not need to worry about alternate spellings or word variations.
